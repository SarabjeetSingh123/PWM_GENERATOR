### PWM_GENERATOR
###### The code implements a PWM generator with the following features:
Uses a 100 MHz clock as the input.
Adjusts the duty cycle of the PWM signal in 10% increments or decrements using two buttons.
Debounces the button inputs to avoid multiple detections of a single press.
Generates a PWM output signal with a 10 MHz frequency.
